        <h1>Privacy Policy for Rain Lock</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 10, 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Rain Lock ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. 
            This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Rain Lock does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The app operates entirely on your device and processes all data locally. We do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect personal information</li>
            <li>Store user data on external servers</li>
            <li>Share data with third parties</li>
            <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
            <li>Access your contacts, messages, or other personal files</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
        <p>Rain Lock requires the following permissions to function:</p>

        <h3>Required Permissions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</strong> (Display over other apps)
                <br>This permission is essential for the app's core functionality. It allows Rain Lock to display an overlay that blocks accidental touches during rain while you use navigation apps.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE</strong>
                <br>Required to maintain the overlay service running in the background while you use other apps.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</strong> (Android 13+)
                <br>Required to show a persistent notification indicating that the overlay service is active.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong> (Android 11+)
                <br>Used to detect when navigation apps (Google Maps, Waze, etc.) are running, enabling automatic activation of touch blocking.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Optional Permissions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION / ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</strong>
                <br>Only used if you enable the weather-based auto-enable feature. This permission allows the app to check your location for weather conditions. Location data is never stored or transmitted - it's only used locally to determine if rain is detected in your area. You can disable this feature entirely in the app settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>READ_PHONE_STATE</strong>
                <br>Used to detect incoming phone calls and automatically disable touch blocking so you can answer calls. No phone numbers or call data is stored or transmitted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>INTERNET</strong>
                <br>Only used if you enable the weather feature to fetch weather data. Weather API requests are made directly from your device and no personal information is included in these requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>VIBRATE</strong>
                <br>Used for optional haptic feedback when touches are blocked. No data is collected.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>
            Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no information to use, share, or sell. 
            All app functionality operates entirely on your device using local processing only.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All app settings and preferences are stored locally on your device using Android's built-in 
            SharedPreferences system. This data never leaves your device and is deleted when you 
            uninstall the app.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Rain Lock may use third-party weather APIs (such as OpenWeatherMap) if you enable the 
            weather-based auto-enable feature. When this feature is used:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only your approximate location (city-level) is sent to the weather API</li>
            <li>No personal identifiers are included</li>
            <li>Weather data is cached locally and not stored permanently</li>
            <li>You can disable this feature at any time in settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please refer to the weather API provider's privacy policy for their data handling practices.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Rain Lock does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we do not 
            collect any personal data, this is not applicable. The app is safe for users of all ages.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete.</p>
        <p>You have full control over the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can disable any optional permissions in Android settings</li>
            <li>You can uninstall the app at any time, which removes all local data</li>
            <li>You can disable features (like weather) that require additional permissions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes 
            by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
        </p>
